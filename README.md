List of great sources to become Master in Computer Vision

## Basics

[PyImageSearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/)
> Best practical guide for different simple tasks that could be done with Computer Vision Algorithms. Easy to try and to get basic understanding of OpenCV API using Python. There are a lot of guides how to deploy CV programs on Raspberry Pi.


[Udacity. Computational photography](https://www.udacity.com/course/computational-photography--ud955)

[Udacity. Intro to Computer Vision](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)

> Udacity prepared two great courses to get basic understanding of standart algorithms in COmputer Vision. Courses have common videos but it would be awesome to learn from both.

[Stanford. CS 131. Computer Vision: Foundations and Applications](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1617/schedule.html)
> Optional course. I used it to try solve problem set in assignments. Nice lectures notes. 

## Intermediate

[Stanford. Digital image processing](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee368/schedule.html)

[Stanford. Computational Imaging and Display](http://stanford.edu/class/ee367/)
> More courses on understanding what is digital image about. How it is created and how it could be processed.

## Advanced

[Georgia Tech. CS 7476. Advanced Computer Vision](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/7476/)
[Geometry of Computer Vision and Graphics](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/a4m33gvg/start)
> Described more advanced techniques on how Deep Learning affects on modern Computer Vision and some algorithms to work with 3D.

[Stanford. Mobile Computer Vision](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231m/syllabus.html)
> Described techniques how to run Computer Vision application on mobile devices (mostly for IOS). Great explanation on mobile devices power consumption and limitations for high performance applications.
